# Minimal Floo Server Configuration
# ==================================
# Generate credentials with:
#   openssl rand -base64 32  (for psk)
#   openssl rand -base64 24  (for token)

# Accept reverse tunnel from clients and expose publicly

# Or allow clients to reach internal services through tunnel
